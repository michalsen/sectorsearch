v.01 SectorSearch

...just another silly idea from the Mad Michalsen Labs

v.02 SectorSearch

TO DO


turns out the TODO is way to long here. So many issues.

* db credentials in key file and .key file in .gitignore
* R::setup in Class
* New player needs to utilize Class
* Sector layout is not correct
* Sector math is not working at edge
